            Argument 1: What makes something a moral obligation?

          <div class = "reasoning">
            utilitarianism is the best principle in this scenario. The way that we come to ontological principles like you shouldn’t lie is typically by utilitarian framing, that is it’s better to live in a world where everyone doesn’t lie or at least tries not to. Similarly, it’s better on balance not to have children.

            Therefore, we believe the utilitarian principle is the correct metric to evaluate the moral framing in this debate.
            
            I also think Opp has a uniquely difficult barrier to overcome. The fact that this is a biological children, the emotional attachment a parent might feel to their biological child pales in comparison to adoption and the value that comes from taking a child that would not otherwise have parents and giving them parents.
          <br><br>
          The unique burden of Opp is to prove that not only is having children itself a moral good, but that it exists preferentially to taking care of the millions of children in this world without a home.
            
            We say that we feel a responsibility with regards to humanity at large, towards one another, because we recognize mutual and reciprocal capacity to suffering. There’s an arbitrary value to your happiness of being a parent. The arbitrary value of happiness that you experience over someone else’s happiness is something you cannot know.

            Argument 2: Children cannot consent to being born
          </div>

            This is important for three reasons:

            1) They have no ability to weigh up the good and bad aspects of being born, and they are unable to opt out of being born.
            2) Children have no alternative once they have been born. Consent needs you to have meaningful choices available and children don’t have that.
            3) Parents are asserting their agency over the life of another human being. We say this is an act of structural violence in the literal definition of violence because you’re dictating the terms by which another individual is able to access and opt into a lifetime of suffering or a lifetime of pleasure.            

            <br><br>

            Even in the best case scenario where a child does find their life rewarding and they look back on their deathbed and say this has been a net positive experience, we would still say that the decision to have a child is a bad one because they weren’t able to fully evaluate the alternative. They aren’t able to say, “If I hadn’t been born, this is the proper counterfactual world which would have existed”. Therefore, it’s an act of aggregated consent.
