            Argument: Accessibility of drugs
          </div>

          <div class = "reasoning">
          Firstly, there’s little competition because oftentimes these firms operate in different fields, even if there are multiple firms in the industry. And this is because there is a first-mover advantage in the pharma industry. So once you start establishing a drug, everyone flocks to you and it’s harder for future firms to come in. The opposition might respond to this with COVID. Most diseases aren’t as widespread as COVID, and not every company is starting at the same time. Once one company has gotten the opportunity to entrench itself, it is much harder in the future. So this is why insulin is almost exclusively produced by Novo in the States and why epinephrine is monopolised by EpiPen.
          <br><br>
          Secondly, you need IP protection like patents to incentivise production. This is why Opposition can’t just say they’ll have price caps. These are impossible since then firms would just stop producing drugs. Prices are driven up by patented technology. Since there is no competition, oftentimes it becomes extremely unaffordable. This is why Insulin is $10,000 for a month’s supply in the United States, but it’s barely above production costs in Canada. It’s because, in the US, private firms and their patents make it so that there is largely only one seller and they can jack up prices however they want. On the flip side, governments are held accountable by voters. There’s a huge backlash if people die or if they’re forced into having to pay exorbitant amounts of money for life-saving treatments. Governments are made to seem like tyrants in these cases. Even if Big Pharma is seen as the same, they don’t really care because all they want is profit, whereas governments care about their perception.
          <br><br>
          Thirdly, pharmaceutical goods are inelastic. What we mean by that is that people are desperate if they have something like cancer, so they will buy these drugs no matter what the cost is. Since companies are profit-maximising, it is very easy to price gouge as much as you want because people need those drugs to save their lives.

            Argument: Government-run firms have bad incentives in terms of their production of pharmaceuticals
          </div>

          <div class = "reasoning">
            First, it’s because of government short-termism. Both sides in this debate agree that there’s high risk and high cost of investing in pharmaceuticals. The problem on their side is that if you are a government, as I mentioned before, the benefit to you from the development of that drug goes to your successor rather than you, whereas on the comparative, companies remain the same. They pass these election cycles, and therefore there’s an incentive to break into these new markets.
          <br><br>
          Second, on the specific metric of safety that Proposition tells us about, governments are actually a lot more short-termist because often these particular problems with drugs are only found out many years down the road by which time again another government is in power. Therefore, governments have incentives to fast-track the development of drugs, bypassing safety procedures so as to get short-term political benefits. In contrast, companies’ reputations don’t disappear after four years. For instance, GSK still has a bad reputation from the development of thalidomide in the 1960s because that had bad effects on pregnant women. There are therefore stronger incentives for companies to actually maintain higher standards of safety on our side of the house.
            
          <br><br>
          Finally, Proposition harms the development of medical technology overall. Many technologies start off non-medical, for example, the mRNA technology used in the COVID-19 vaccine was originally used in agricultural fermentation. The problem is that specific research is needed to develop the medical applications of these technologies. On their side, the moment you engage in that research, all of your technology is now seized by the government as a pharmaceutical. And there is therefore no incentive for holders of patents for these particular intermediary technologies to develop medical applications of their technologies. They will either hide these particular technologies from governments or simply not extend their medical applications. What this means is there is no innovation in terms of medical products on their side of the house. On our side, when we ensure that these individuals can continue to hold on to their patents, we, therefore, ensure there’s a continued incentive to innovate.
