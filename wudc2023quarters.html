                A significant number of [motivations for crime] are cost benefit analysis.
                Things like out of economic necessity. 
                I would note that you change this cost benefit analysis and so far as you remove the punishment of time. 
                And therefore people can go back to their daily lives after a crime has been committed.
                <br><br>
                But why is deterrence particularly important? These crimes are particularly dangerous. They can psychologically harm someone. 
                They can economically ravage someone.
                I would note it's not just that. But large crimes within communities as a whole decrease investment, decrease political 
                will and so far as people take that these are crime-ridden communities that ought not be protected.

                And I'd note the principle weighing here. 
                I'd say number one is on scale. Even if locking up someone could potentially harm a family, it's much more dangerous that one criminal 
                can harm multiple other families as well as a bigger harm on scale. But secondly in terms of innocence. 
                I'd say the consequences are best recorded to the particular individual that this affects. Note that this cost benefit analysis is much 
                stronger on our side when the punishment is better and therefore they're just less willing to pursue this crime in the first place.
