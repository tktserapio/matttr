            First, it is found and it is acquired unjustly. In the vast majority of instances the reason why wealthy countries are wealthy is through processes like colonialism, through slavery, through patriarchy. It represents plunder when you refuse to give any representation or resources to whom or from whom you took money. But even if it wasn’t in those direct instances of theft. In many instances it was negligence.
          <br><br>
          The second thing it enables the poor in terms of a principle, is that it allows them to get redress in opposition to centuries of disenfranchisement. That is to say, theft and negligence represent the stripping of the individual right to assert themselves. We’re going to give you systematic reasons why you don’t get reforms on their side, but notice that this as a principled argument is independent from a consideration of practices. That’s to say compensation, or giving more money, is unlike categorically, what these people require in principle, which is a redress from the fact that they’ve been taken out of the system of moral equality by theft and negligence.
          <br><br>
          The last thing to say is that let’s take them at their best. That is, let’s wipe the slate clean and accept that everybody has access to resources. Why then is property still oppressive and why does it represent an assault on human dignity. The first reason is that competition and the premises on which it is based is artificial. That is to say, trade on morally insignificant or arbitrary factors. The fact of scarcity, which allows many corporations to  succeed. The fact that I was born with certain talents or certain skills that other individuals weren’t, we think  those are morally arbitrary from the consideration of dessert and we don’t think that’s just grounds.

            Because we get that the principle that "this is what you deserve", "it's better to fight even if you are going to fail". Okay, it is principally deplorable to choose an option that will not only condemn millions of global poor to live in a post-revolution society where the people who control the economic and political leaps of power are now prejudiced against them, but to subject the poor to enconomic, politic and violent destruction, right? If you have two choices before you, and you choose to endanger the lives of billions of the most endangered people in the world, that is principally abhorrent. So we're going to take it on that basis.
          <br><br>
          Okay, let's talk about how this revolution looks when it fails, because they admit that it'll fail in almost all countries. In the US, this is going to fail; Europe, this is going to fail. What are the harms of a failed Marxist revolution? It puts the interests of the poor diametrically opposed to the interest of the wealthy; this revolution threaten the property rights of the people who have power in society; political power, economic power; it threatens the lives that they have built for their family; it is based on the generations of wealth that you intend to pass on to your children; you threaten to take away everything from the people who have power. This will lead to a hatred, or at least an opposition, to the poor. The biggest risk is that this revolution fails and the people who have political power in the open world turn against the poor domestically and internationally. 
            <br><br>
            What does this look like domestically? Look at how tenuous any welfare policy is in the United States currently. Look at how thin a margin Obamacare passed to give basic medical care to the poor of the United States. The reason that you got this kind of support is on a broad based rhetoric that the poor deserve our help; that their interest are in line with ours, that they deserve help and that we can help in this way. If you make it so that the poor are a threat to the wealthy and the economic powerful in these countries, those policies will certainly fail.
