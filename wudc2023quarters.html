                Future loans cannot give you things like agricultural subsidies, the vast majority of your electorate is frustrated.
                This looks like farmer unions and trade unions. The short-term election incentive overrules the incentive
                to get that loan
                Second of all, note that it also makes you look extremely weak in nations
                where your actual strength against the idea of westernism is very important, because a lot of these are post-colonial states -- you know the Indians don't
                really love the British telling them what to do -- as a result, often, it looks a bit bad when it literally looks like the IMF is telling you what to do and things
                are extremely unpopular and you're blaming them as an excuse in the first place. 
                But third of all, it's important because even if they are competent, the incompetent ones will opt out, which is enough for GOV to win this debate.

                What does this mean? This means they'll switch to China. China is still continuing the BRI given that it is floundering locally; it needs to invest externally. 
                As a result, Chinese loans are taken by these nations, and there are bad impacts to these countries: their infrastructure is stolen,
                China is more untrustworthy given that their legal system is not completely independent and they get screwed over in trade deals, and China is not a multilateral actor.

              Three responses why these countries won’t turn to China. Firstly, China has significantly more limited resources right now. They're reeling from COVID and they're also reeling from an internal inward-world by developing the domestic market. And the investment made to project outward trades off in Xi Jinping's capacity to invest locally and domestically. Secondly, China's also pissed off a large number of countries. The very stock analysis about debt traffic diplomacy, whereby China sees the port in Guadal Pakistan and also in Sri Lanka, and things like that, the market has just slated a lot of countries who are trading with China. So for countries on the fence, they're very unlikely to say some conditions that require a similar few competitive advantages for our market versus China traffic does its debt. And then literally stealing our port and occupying our land are two very different things. So the weighing is quite clear, right? 
              <br><br>
              Finally, if their logic is true, they're still at a competitive deficit with China. So if there are some countries on the fence that are really leaning China at the SQ and things like this, they're still going to be brought by the company IMF by anti-corruption reforms. Why are anti-corruption reforms the most salient? Quite obviously, because anti-corruption reforms could force the political party out of power and the people in these countries want to stay in power longer. Therefore, they are very likely to just turn to China on their side if that's something that happens.
