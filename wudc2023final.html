            Argument: These [communities] become less and less good for you and make you less and less happy. 
          </div>

          <div class = "reasoning">
          Why will penalties and obligations manifest badly? One, because everyone believes in it and therefore no one questions it,
          it is almost impossible to come up with the confidence to speak up in status quo. Beyond that it is impossible or difficult to have reasonable and visible examples
          of other people trying to speak out in the first place and it's difficult to leave: if community is so important to government, we could never feasibly leave.
          But secondly and worst of all is that once they feel the need to instrumentalise you you feel like you're strung along.
          It's become a part of your identity which means it's hard for you to criticise internally because you feel so deeply connected to yourself.
          But thirdly and finally that it never occurs to you that the obligation is a problem in the first place and lays the blame on other groups of people
          <br><br>
            First, communities tend to impose arbitrary value on you upon birth. They are built up with traditionalist, conservative beliefs that do not fit the worldview of today.
          If you're that LGBT person in OG’s example, how do you stop heteronormative standards from being forced down your throat?
          Second, values and beliefs within communities become more malleable on Opp. More people question these things and criticise whether or not they're good.
          This impact has two immediate outcomes. First, the actual services themselves get better since the pool [of resources] is not done towards harming people but 
          actual good in the first place. Second, people are more receptive to criticism. If you don't feel like this is a critical part of your identity you are more 
          receptive to change within this community because you don't feel like it's an assault on your identity and you don't feel like stagnancy is necessary for 
          stability.

            Extension: What are the instances in which today people prioritise themselves over their community?
          </div>

          <div class = "reasoning">
            <b>1) </b>When they think the personal benefit to them is larger than what they would get from the community;
            In instances when they think they could get more than from the community directly,
            say if i could make a crime and get away with it, a reason in which I attempted to prioritise myself.
            Two crucial reasons why this goes better on our side: A) Because some identity that is grounded in community means that hurting the community
            is equivalent to hurting myself, you are less likely to do bad to your community.
            B) It means that there's no need to get caught. It's really hard to catch criminals and deter them from doing crime.
            Under our side they don't need to get caught. Their own guilt, their own conscience, will haunt them.
          <br>
            <b>2)</b> People think that they are bad and don't deserve that you care for them or prioritise them.
            We think that under our side, you know that not just you,
            but everyone around you also believes in that, meaning that you know that they care for you and are going to serve you in the future.
            This means you are less likely to have stigmas against people in the first place.
            <br>
            <b>3)</b> We also view community in this world based on what the community does for me.
            Note, the wording in the info-slide: I feel obligated to the community. It directly ties to what the community has done for me.
            This is what I'm more likely to feel affiliated with me rather than just the colour of my skin.
            
          <br><br>
          What are the impacts of this? Firstly, we think that this means in this world, people have significantly less stigma and racism.
          Note: OO says, on both sides there is communitarianism. The difference is, today, I associated with my nationality
          or my race. I am less likely to apply to things that are relevant to my obligation to them
          and more likely to associate with things that are about my direct identity, meaning that it's less likely to be about wider circles.
          Secondly, we also get people who do less bad things, less crime in the first place, proving less active harm, not just more donations.
          Thirdly, it also means people who treat each other better personally
          because they extend community to each individual around them, which doesn't have to go through specific societal systems that we choose for Gov.
