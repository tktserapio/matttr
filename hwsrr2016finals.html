            1) A lot of the local population actually supports the West when it’s deployed in many different cases. Many Palestinians who live in the Gaza Strip hate Hamas as well. It’s actually a way to rally up population.

            2) Look to something that’s about the understanding of this debate. This is not a debate that the West should never have done it. This is a debate that is happening now.

            Why does that matter?

            Because if this is already something which is associated with the West in many different cases, the local populations have a clear incentive to frame the West for assassinations of different terrorist groups because there are many competing ones anyway.

            3) Based on OG's alternative, you’re deploying sanctions on the local population when you’re disrupting the supply chain. You’re preventing them food because in many of the cases these are the organizations that are in charge of the welfare of the population.

            1) In many cases, centralization is inherent to the way that terrorist organizations operate. Why is that correct? Because in many different situations, you have a capacity that in order to operate you need a lot of trust between different parts of the organization. Why? Because in order to make sure you can subvert Western intelligence agencies, this is something that you need only a small amount of people to have the information of what is likely going on because you have a chance of leaks.
            2) Moreover, you can use this tool to send the organization into disarray. Actually frame different members of the organization.

            How do you do this? Let’s look at what Israel does. You frame specifically when someone goes to buy cigarette with their deputy every single time, this is when you hit them. Why does that happen? Because essentially then you assume that one of the deputies have leaked the information of when this individual goes outside.
