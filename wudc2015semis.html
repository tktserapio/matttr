          <div class = "reasoning">
          We’re going to give you the materialist power that says the source of all political power is in economic control. Why is that the case.
          <br><br>
          First of all, you reduce the pay gap. We not only think that women are more likely to pay other women higher wages, by and large we think that the fact of relative equality exists in societies and hiring women. It means that women have capital for the first time that they’re able to wield, not only in a political sense, but within the family where they can use their own money because it’s something they earn.

Second, it leads to political enfranchisement right. We’re likely to say that on the comparative in India, rape and the abuse of women is far less likely to be a problem in a city in which women hold power, women can tell the police that this is not okay.

Third it incentivizes the state to increase education for women because they know that that is going to be the workforce, particularly important in cities.

          <div class = "handle"> 
            Argument 2: This is economically beneficial to the state.
          </div>

          <div class = "reasoning">
            First of all, there exists no free market in a segregated state. A state doesn’t operate ….. When they randomly select 50% of the population and don’t give them jobs for which they are qualified. It means they don’t have the best people doing the labor that’s available. It means some people aren’t incentivized to seek out an education because they know they won’t have access to those opportunities.
          <br><br>
          Second, this reduces the gender imbalance particularly in developing countries. For every man, ah, for every one woman, there is 1.3 men in many of these areas. How does this change under our side? First of all, it means that families are less likely to take the kinds of actions that leads to the gender imbalance. It means things like neglect when they are infants. It means things like sex selective abortions. The benefits of that not only accrue to women, whose perception is they are lesser, but to all of society. Social imbalances in gender have greater rates of crime, greater rates of rape, greater rates of unhappiness, right. Those things cost the state billions upon billions of dollars to rectify every year, and it’s not getting better.
