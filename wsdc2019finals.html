            First, on humanitarian interventions.
            Notice that these are the only interventions that actually need people on the ground. Why is that the case? In order to deliver aid, in order to bring food packages, to rescue people from burning buildings, humanitarian interventions need soldiers on the ground.
            In a world where soldiers are your heroes, when soldiers are the most important people in that country, one soldier from your nation can’t be weighed against black or brown people from around the developing world.
            These kinds of interventions become much less likely. When images of bodybags become much more powerful for people, e.g. in Mogadishu, the intervention resulted in soldiers being hurt, the US stopped going to Rwanda.
            The only kind of interventions that crucially need soldiers on the ground are the kind of interventions we decrease massively.            
          <br><br>
          Second, on interventions in self-interest.
          Note these interventions don’t require people. You can act in your military self-interest by doing things like carrying out drone strikes in Syria. These are not interventions for which you need boots on the ground.
          These interventions become more likely at the point soldiers, and in extension the military is glorified, as an actor which can do no wrong.
          But even if in these kind of interventions, which are rarer but do occur anyways, if you do send soldiers, they act with more impunity.
          They see themselves as people who cannot be hurt. When you go back to your nation, no matter what you do, flags will wait for you, people will be proud of you no matter what.
          When you’re going to be seen as a hero no matter what you do, it’s easier for you to sexually assault someone. Easier for you to carry out a war crime. Easier for you to shoot someone without having to think twice about it, considering that you know no one will say anything. You’re still going to be the hero. You’re still going to be the soldier that was fighting for that country.
          All of this means soldiers, in the interventions that they do, become more likely to act in ways which are damaging to people on the ground.
