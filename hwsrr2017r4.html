          <div class = "reasoning">
            This is overexposure. Let’s make an analogy and then explain. This is not sadness, in a sense, it’s marijuana, however, this is heroin in the way that overexposure actually works. The tendency of individuals is to be risk-averse in many cases and care much more about what they have to lose, and as they say in the Opening Opposition, this is something which is likely to be predominant of your life for a long period of time.

Even if this is something which is eventually going to fade away in the emotional reserve, the complete obsession and the course that my life has taken at essentiality is something which is likely to be completely changed as they accept by the Opening Opposition.

And now note what it essentially does to me. If I now experience an emotion to that degree, I’m likely to trivialize any other emotion on the spectrum. Here is the logic of that. If I am in the army and have killed another individual, the likely scenario is that every other experience might seem trivial to me because I just don’t understand why it matters after having that experience.

            <div class = "handle">
              Argument 2: Why it’s actually likely to lead to less empathy.
            </div>
            <br>

But look. The mere fact that I’m now going to be more aversive towards people that I love and actually need me because I know I’ve lost a loved one before, I’m going to have less of a capacity to try to expose myself to a new wife later on, or to try to have a dependency upon other people.

Because if I have overarching memory that is going to know that everyone is essentially going to die, my capacity, my willingness to actually try to have dependency upon other people is something which is going to be significantly reduced.

Note, this is something which is horrible. Why?

Because essentially, the dependency upon others, as they say, something which is crucial for the vast majority of positive experiences, as they again hint in a POI from CO as well, and most of the case of OO. And the fact that in order to actually have maintained empathy and to have construct of other feelings is something which is also dependent upon others. If this is something which is likely to happen to me, this is bad.
