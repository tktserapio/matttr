            Issue 1: Do people care about others?
          </div>

          <div class = "reasoning">
            Is the moral weight that you ascribe to others going to be a high level or a low level of a moral weight if everyone is seen to be of equal moral weight?

            Firstly, we think it’s likely to be high. And the reason for that is because it’s necessary for this debate to function. OO in themselves admit that people have a feeling of reciprocity, fondness and a desire to help others. I Shaun gave you a bunch of reasons why human beings in general are suffering a lot. We don’t like seeing other people who look like us suffering and having to go through pain because we can extrapolate that to ourselves and feel as if that might be problematic for us.
          <br><br>
          The second thing is just that humans are social creatures. At a point in which we interact with others, we’re also likely to believe that other human beings deserve to be saved. Even if we are to extrapolate the moral way to everyone, presumably that is going to be a high level of valuation that we have for each specific individual and not a low one because that is the immediate intuition that most people would have, and the alternative is no moral weight ascribed to them. 
          <br><br>
          But presumably, in a world in which we have started off seeing everyone as being of equal moral weight, then that is not the same world that we’re in right now. The accumulation and capitalisation of resources within a few concentrated groups is what is denying the rest of the world the capacity to be able to share those resources and making the suffering of the world so overwhelming. The walls, the slavery, the starvation — everything that we have right now is the result of the fact that we don’t see people as being of equal moral weight, and we have allowed for the accumulation and concentration of resources in a few small pockets or groups. That is the reason why it seems like the suffering is overwhelming.

In a world in which everyone was treated the same from the start, this is a world in which we have probably created things like centralised system of aid for other individuals or systems in which we are able to ensure that the transfer of resources happen so that we can prevent suffering from people from other places. This is a place in which things like racism, for example, would not have existed because these kinds of arbitrary markers when it comes to identity, and the ascription or responsibilities and obligations to each individual does not exist.

            Issue 2: How do people make decisions, and why are these things likely to be good?
          </div>

          <div class = "reasoning">
            The first thing to note is that people just make decisions that are of a significantly greater amount of compassion. If I see everyone as being of equivalent moral weight to myself, then I’m taking each person’s problems equally seriously as the kind of problems that I would want to make and the kind of suffering that I am likely to go through. This, therefore, suggests that we will have considered opinions from people around the globe to try as best as to maximise the utility of each individual person.
          <br><br>
          But secondly, I think they ignore the framing and setup that came from Shaun in the first place. A lot of the things that currently prevent our capacity to be able to create these systems of redistribution, such as global networks of help, no longer exists because we don’t have things like strongly defined states or identity groups that disrupt our capacity to be able to share and create negotiation and discussions about how we can help other people that exist in the world around us as well.
