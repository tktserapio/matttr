              <p>For the purposes of this debate, "fiscal central banking" refers to an economic system that grants central 
                banks the mandate to control circulation of money in the economy through fiscal policy in addition to monetary policy. 
                Under this system central banks can define limitations for the size of the budget, but not its distribution. 
                i.e. they can decide rates for various taxes and limit or increase overall government spending, but can't decide 
                what the money is spent on

                <p>During the recent economic crisis, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has provided certain conditions to developing countries for receiving loans. These conditions require governments to adopt more market based economic policies. Targets include reducing government budget deficits and increasing international currency reserves. The policy conditions provided by the IMF include 1) reducing or eliminating fuel subsidies and fertiliser subsidies; 2) setting the currency exchange rate to international market rates; 3) implementing market-based interest rates; 4) anti corruption provisions.
