            Argument 1: The prerequisite for any meaningful policy to be
            successful and effective relies on the leader’s political character
          </div>

          <div class = "reasoning">
            First, we think that when you only base yourself around policy, and only think about the candidate that can give you political effectiveness, you don’t take into account the morality behind those policies. This is not to say that the policies are entirely unconstitutional. Trump’s Muslim ban, for example, (unintelligible) is still within the legal bounds of American constitution. But that Trump ban on Muslim still violates human rights. It only panders to the frightfulness and fearfulness of one’s society. And can effectively provide immigration policies to the people that violate the morality of other people. What we need to understand is that we do not always get the leader
            that we like or the leader that are within our political ability. So we need to ensure that we don’t always think about policy that’s effective but also moral so that when the next time a leader that we don’t like doesn’t come in, we are not the brunt of these things.
          <br><br>
          Secondly, policies are exclusionary unlike character. When someone is honest and caring for you, it is not exclusive to your race, your group or your gender.

But policies can never accommodate everyone in the society. Not every policy, economic policy for example, can cater to every sector of the society. So that means, sometimes that policies are effectively good for some people and effectively bad for others. When you have a good political character, you’re able to create both participants’ support. Which you want to listen to and provide mitigating factors in your provision so that it doesn’t hurt the other side too much. And even when you get your political effectiveness, at the end of the day, it won;t be something that is too damaging to the other side in which politics is only a win-lose game.
